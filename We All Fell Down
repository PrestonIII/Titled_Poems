There came a day,
As days do come,
When time and space conspire
To reject me getting any hire.
The heights I soared
Could not be ignored
The birds, the stars
Both Venus and Mars
Looked on in envy, wrath and jealousy
But why was I to care,
I could fly where none other did dare.
Along I went
My mind unbent
On what was my purpose.
